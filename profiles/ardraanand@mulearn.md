### About me
I love learning new things and always fascinated by the facts to learn about the world. I am non judgemental and a good listener.I enjoy listening to music, watching movies and reading books.
I deeply care about the feelings of other people and empathetic.I think creativity and passion in any form, be it through technology or music, contribute to generating my innovative mindset. I am excited about the opportunities and connections that IEEE provides to enable me to improve my skills and make a positive contribution on the tech landscape. 

#### Leadership and Influence:
Leading is not only about directing others, but also about the ability to listen, empathize, and collaborate. A trait I hold confidence in is that I am a good listener. Whether it is in a project with a group or a conversation with an individual, listening to the ideas and issues of people around me is something I strive to do, which allows me to connect well with peers, mentors, and teammates. 
I am dedicated to developing my leadership skills by being not only a guide, but also a listener and a partner. I think this is a key aspect of being an influencer in my area—open dialogue, cultivating innovation, and ultimately making a difference.

#### Networking:
To me, networking is not purely a means of connectivity, it is about deepening a relationship and creating a community. I have honed my networking skills over the years through participation in events, workshops, and team projects, in my university community, as well as in the greater tech community. I intentionally take to time to listen to others and gain an understanding of their perspective and see how I can provide encouragement or support. These developments have not only created a strong network, but also made me a go-to for advice or collaboration in many cases.
In an effort to get more involved in the community, I want to be more active in organizing and participating in local tech events, such as startup pitch competitions or workshops at universities. I have a particular interest in promoting environments that allow people to work together to solve real-world problems. For example, I can see myself leading hackathons or innovation challenges with a purpose-focus - making progress on meaningful issues at local or global scale, such as education or sustainable development. These events would offer participants a chance to grow and learn while providing me with opportunities to act as a mentor and lead by example. I will not only strengthen my relationships but will also assist to build the local ecosystem by providing a place for ideas to grow.

#### Career Plan:
My main objective will be engaging proactively with the Kerala startup ecosystem at networking events, workshops, and meetups organized by platforms like Kerala Startup Mission. This experience will help me understand better the challenges of early-stage startups and start building meaningful connections with other entrepreneurs, industry experts, and stakeholders. Through networking and collaborations, I am committed to enabling opportunities for similar experiences and collaboration, both of which can be important for startups to overcome early-stage limitations and flourish. I also would like to provide mentorship to young entrepreneurs, particularly around business strategy, product development, and market entry. This is part of providing individuals with guidance to navigate the complexities of starting up and the expertise to scale their startups. I would also like to partner with academic institutions to think about internships, innovation challenges, and collaborative research efforts. These partnerships will support improving the link between academia and startups while providing students with real-world experiences and providing startups with fresh talent and innovative ideas.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:
 With a combination of short- and long-term initiatives, I aim to contribute to building a dynamic, sustainable, and globally competitive startup ecosystem in Kerala. Whether through mentorship, stimulating innovation, advocating for ecosystem policies, or facilitating collaboration across disciplines, I am committed to enabling startups to achieve their full potential. Ultimately, I hope to help evolve Kerala into an entrepreneurial hub with a supportive ecosystem for creativity and startups, which will have access to the resources, tools, and networks they need to be successful.
As for my long-term goal, I plan to help create a culture of experimentation and risk-taking in Kerala's local startup ecosystem. I want to organize and take part in hackathons, ideathons, and startup bootcamps that enable entrepreneurs to experiment, take calculated risks, and come up with creative solutions to existing problems. I consider these as essential to creating a culture of resilience and innovation among emerging entrepreneurs. I also want to create a comprehensive mentorship network that connects new startups with successful entrepreneurs, industry veterans, and venture capitalists. This will be critical in helping new startups receive ongoing support, strategic advice, and the capital they need to succeed.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:
I have not had the opportunity to contribute to open sourceprojects till now, but i am interested to participate in open source contributions.

#### History of Community Engagement:
I’ve been very active on Discord servers based around tech-related discussions and solution finding. In addition to technical forums, I have also volunteered extensively for Adharva fest at my college. Adharva fest is one of my college’s largest technical fests, and I volunteered to contribute to the technical events and implications surrounding the event.

#### Highly Visible Technical Content:

As part of my ongoing committment to share and participate in the tech community, I wrote a post on Medium, called "My Travel Experience." This blog describes my travel experience with my family. By writing on Medium, I have been able to reach a wider audience of developers, tech enthusiasts, and learners while sharing practical advice, step-by-step tutorials, and practical ideas in hopes to help others learn new technologies and improve their skills.
#### Highly Used Software Tools:

Figma is one of the most powerful tools I've used in my design workflow, which is a cloud-based design tool that enables users to collaborate on projects in real-time. Figma has also become an integral part of my design toolbox, and the collaborative aspects are why it is so commonly used with teams that are working on large and complex design-oriented tasks. Since many designers, prototypers, and system designers can collaborate within the same tool, I have collectively designed systems that enhance user experience in both functionality and, in many cases, visual design for its end-users in various domains.
